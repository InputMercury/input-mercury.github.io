      <p>dream from this morning 8/31/2022 @ 2:45 AM</p>

      <h3>Most Memorable Dreams: </h3>
      <br/>
      
      <h5>The dream with lock</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>We were waiting in front of a bus/ van/ vehicle. It was a group of us. We bickered and made lighthearted fun, but i snuck off during an argument. Tony lived next door, and i had spoke with the driver of the vehicle. He told me he was moving out, but he would still be back on saturdays to work. I stole snacks and tools from his house while he was on the phone. I brought them over to our house and stashed them for our trip. </li>
          <li>We headed to the area. We all split up, and it just sort of started. We were running around quietly. I was wearing loosely fitting clothes and light footing. But i felt like a heavyweight, but agile and smooth. The sky was black, but the ground and building were dimly lit. the creatures/ people/ things started appearing. They were almost sort of stagnant, until they noticed you at least. Then they would quickly approach. They didnt seem to move much, they just sort of floated towards me. They were sort of pixeled, blurred out as they were further away. But as they approached, you could notice their facial features and their varying hair features. They all looked similar. Grey skin bald heads, and hyperrealistic features on a weird outline of their bodies. There mouths moved fast and slow, whispering things that couldnt be made out. They were somehow still blurry even though i could tell they were hyperrealistic. I had to for some reason lure them in to kill em. I either beat em to a pulp, until i eventually got a weapon from one of them. I started slicin em up, until i found a gun. I distinctly remember one got really close, and it started to grow a second head. From then, there were other ones with heads in different locations on their bodies. Some with heads in their abdomen. I had to charge through them to get to the objective. Before i could get there, lock appeared. He was either helping us or stopping us, but i can never remember where things go after that point. He had a somewhat glittered purple smoke around him, which dissipated too quickly to be that noticeable. </li>
          <li>Lock was armored up. A ring cicled his face, just at his eye level. A ring covered in eyes from every couple inches apart. It slowly spun around his head, and the eyes seemed to be focused on me. I could just barely see his nose and mouth. He had a silver halo. Dark metal gear covered his body. Armor. He had daggers for feathers on his metal wings. They circled him closely, not spread wide apart. He wasnt frowning, he was just sort of staring, if he had eyes. A dark blue light filled the room he was almost in a small room of some kind. Every time i saw him, the dream reset. </li>

          <li>Haven and Mikayla were at the end of the dream</li>
        </ul>

      <h5>The demon with the red claw like fingers</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>long and red, darker at the tips. They were hovering right outside my field of vision. Right next to my hands as i walked. Almost like it was following me or guarding me</li>
          <li><h5>Separate mansion dream from this mornin 9/1/2022</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>The demon that we had to bring into the mansion dream</li>
          </ul></li>
        </ul>

      <h5>Planet dreams where the planets were crashing into ours while i was driving off somewhere</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>to do</li>
        </ul>

      <h5>the red tinted vision dream from sheppard pratt</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>to do</li>
        </ul>

      <h5>Recurring mansion dream: </h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Im always being hunted in a mansion, or hiding for dear life. </li>
          <li>Its always me and a group of people trying to hide and not get caught</li>
          <li>Theres always a sense of security at the end, but on most instances theres a sense of grief or further suspense after the sense of security. What does this have to do with anything? Why does this hardly correlate with anything. </li>
          <li>The only mansion ive ever been in was Lawyer Mark’s house. Unless the mansion is my brain’s way of interpreting something, why is it always a mansion or a massive building? </li>
          <li>It’s always dark with subtle dark yellow or dark orange lights near safety. But its always dimly lit. like candle lit almost </li>
          <li>They almost always end in the basement or the ground level</li>
        </ul>

      <h5>Being hunted at school </h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Always similar to the mansion dream, running around, always scattered. Always high school. Usually a sense of finding something valuable there, but being kicked out or chased down. Like the dream of the school where me vince, justin, kareem, and mikayla were trying to get crystals from rocks on the beach which was somehow connected to the school. We were happy and sort of carefree, but we were serious and determined. Somewhat secretive, but more like scooby doo secretive, like sneaky. We were facing rocks towards the school, while our backs were turned to the beach. The school security caught us and made us put everything back </li>
        </ul>

      <h5>The dream of the sun bear teaching me how to dance and the owl watching from a distance from before most of this. </h5>

            I had parked my car and fell asleep waitin in the car for mikayla to get there. I woke up to someone tying to open my passenger door trying to get in, and I naturally freaked the fuck out. I got them out of the car and they said, why are you freaked out? With a crooked smile, they vanished after I was able to stop them. After stepping out of the car, I noticed a sign with scribbled text. I don’t remember what it said but it made my heart sink. It was something along the lines of “free! Come right on in” as I read the note, dozens of random people without faces started coming towards the car. as I got in the car, they started pulling and tugging the handles as if like raging animals. The doors one by one started unlocking themselves and they were able to open the doors, I had to pull the doors shut manually and keep locking them, and they kept almost getting in, while yelling what’s wrong and laughing. It continued for several minutes. I eventually fixed the lock. And I sat there in tears sobbing. I called the police and said somebody put a note out for my car and begged them to help. They said “we can help, it looks like someone put out a note online for your car” and they removed it. They got to my car and Waited somewhere else. Basically they protected the car. I had gone in a building while waiting for them to get there. I came back out and all the windows and doors were open again. I started sobbing, and I got back in the car and asked mikayla when she was getting here. She was worried and said she was on her way. We were going to a party for her in this giant theater. When we all arrived, we walked through the theater and the door said: OPERATING ROOM. I paid no mind to it. There was a bunch of seats, and we made our way to sit down. Mikayla had a few seats next to her with a few people near. I can’t remember who was on the left side, but they had a blank scribbled out face and weren’t really looking at anything .just talking to the person next to them. Aria was on her other side, from the distance it looked like there weren’t seats open next to her. I went to the row behind her, and as I walked through all the seats were taken. All the guys were in separate seats, but they all had people next to them. I had to go further down the row. I saw Justin talking with Derrick even though they were mad, they were still hanging out as friends, rekindling. I saw Jeff and Paul further down the row. There was a row of empty seats alone, and I reluctantly made my way over to them. As I was sitting down, mikayla was twirling her head back and forth looking for me. She saw me and with that frown smile thing she does, she said what are you doing, there’s a spot over here. There was actually multiple open seats next to her, 2 on the left, 2 on the right. So I happily sat next to her on the right, and we both enjoyed the comfort of the seats, activating the lounge feature where the legs lift up n stuff, all of that. Everyone in the theater was talking to each other, and me and mikayla were happily talkin about random things. A servant brought snacks out, specifically those spicy cinnamon candies. He gave me a few to munch on, and a whole bag for mikayla. It was the funniest thing. My mouth was spicy but they were delicious. Mikayla finished half the bag by the time I got to mine, and she shared with me. She said before everything starts, she wanted me to break open the piñata with a bat because she said I love to do that stuff(which I do) and she’d be happier if I did it. The dream cut off not to long after, but for a moment that felt longer, we just sat there next to each other smiling, and then eventually got up as the dream slowly ended. </p>

      <h5>8/15/2022 King of the hill or something similar</h5>
        <li>
          <p>
            We were all being hunted
            It was in a large building, some aspects like a mansion, we moved in teams or pairs, and I was in a group of 3
            We used our cunning, strength, and careful observation to move throughout the building,
            But there were terrifying beings roaming the premise
            Once we had made it out, there were a few other groups. They called me a coward, but I knew the only way we would make it was if we were careful
            While we had strength, there was no defeating those beasts.
            When we had all gathered, some bosses showed up.
            We were forced to fight then.
            A large purple creature that looked like dark tainted meat and muscle. It arrived in a cloud of smoke and dense air. It seemed to be hovering, no visible legs.
            It moved with its arms hunched over and a twisted head frame. It stared and followed us slowly, but with a demeanor that implied death. We tried circling it, and one of us was lost.
            It vanished in an instant.
            When it was just us remaining, we saw the other groups broken and defeated as well. But we stood there standing alive</p>

      <h5>7/16/2022</h5>
        <li>
            <p>
              I had a nightmare that I had to run to my moms before work to grab something important and was leaving first thing in the morning. I was there trying to be quick and grab something so she didn’t know I was there. I was terrified. She came down the steps and she sent Moses as a scapegoat down to tell me that he wanted to see me. I loved him but I had to decline, I didn’t have an option. When I started to leave she started gradually increasing the sound of her voice and lower the scale of her voice . I couldn’t find my car anywhere. I couldn’t find my cars. She said if I didn’t listen to her that she’d call Mikayla’s mom and tell her I couldn’t live with mikayla. She said she’d trap me there and make me live with her forever. I said where is my car and she just started grinning and laughing. I started panicking and anxiety flooded my brain. Everything started to turn red and she shifted into something else and charged at me.
              I woke up and instantly thought I needed to fight for my life.
              The dream before that, was odd. It may have been the same dream, actually.
              I was hanging out with a random crowd of people in the same home the other dream took place. Haven had found a mouse and was going nuts about it. I had been talking with Mikayla and another random set of people. There was a guy there who was talking about something. I was showing him my new gear and a crossbow or something that I had made myself. He asked me if he wanted to try it out on him. He made me go downstairs and aim at him. He said to test my aim. The bolts were almost like paper clip thin. I shot a couple and one nailed him right in the middle of his forehead. I instantly went into panic and started apologizing profusely. He didn’t even budge. He pulled the bolt out of his forehead and reassured me it was fine. His blood dropped onto my backpack and my art trunk. Then noticed that a couple other bolts I had fired also pierced his flesh. He told me to lick the blood off the bolts. The blood was tasty for some reason. I felt guilty because of how good it tasted. And then suddenly something happened. The whole crowd/ party went nuts and me, mikayla, and the other guy left. Before leaving, the guy started giving me knives to put in my backpack. There was so many in there, that I had to adjust the bag to fit them all in. We left the house and it was for some reason in a mall. We were finally chilling out and made a resting point in the middle of another crowd going into a store. We were talking about something and then mikayla noticed a cop looking around the mall. The guy started panicking saying they’re looking for me, they’re looking for me. He turned dark. His skin was literally darkness, and he started to climb from the floor to the top of the room and stood on top of the furniture. And then he vanished. The cop started interrogating people. Some guy said theoretically could we just continue to go deeper into the crowd and he said, well yeah I can’t really do much but I’m not supposed to say that. For some reason mikayla and I panicked and she made me drive back to our place(?) I realized I left something at the old house, which would be where my mom was. It was Selkirk court house. I snuck in the house in the morning and I couldn’t find what I was looking for. I started frantically trying to leave and that’s where the nightmare began. Mikayla and the car were gone, and I was left stranded in that area, where mom started to become something else

          <li>[where was shannon even involved?]</li>
          <li>[I wrote the note down and took it home, but why did i scramble it?</li>
          <li>It was in the owl room[ where i slept down the hall with the cool windows ][this is where the owl dream was]</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          [brownish yellow flooring] First event was everyone running from something(s?) in the mansion.
          [darker yellow] Me an a few others holed up in this weird room in a basement.
          A man came to the door and knocked or something.
          We had the door locked and it seemed fine, so we let him in.
          After we let him in, the game was over and everything was safe again.
          [darker-darker yellow] That night, it was just me in the room. I could see a shadow figure moving through the walls in the hallway. It was like i could see through the wall, his every movement.
          He stood at the door and stared into the door. It was almost like a window before the doorknob but i couldnt tell.
