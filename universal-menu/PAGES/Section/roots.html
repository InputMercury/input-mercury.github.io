            <li>I think this is where a lot of deep rooted distrust for not only partners, but friends of partners is also rooted.</li>
            <li>I feel like regardless of what happened within myself, this was also a catalyst for a lot of deep-rooted mistrust.</li>
            <li>My higher power() tells me that this was just an unfortunate series of events that happened, and it's not how all people are.</li>
            <li>I think for whatever reason there's two things that could happen as a result and why i found further confirmation in others: </li>
            <li>one is most likely that i attribute every experience to happen exactly as that one did, as a defense mechanism</li>
            <li>or possibly two, i attract those who would have similar attributes. Im not so sure about that, because my behavior could contribute to why somebody might act in that way</li>
            <li>more or less, my conclusion is that; It's seriously not worth my time and energy being so stuck in that thought process. If someone wants to stab me in the back, they'll do it anyways</li>
            <li>regardless of what I would do, circumstances would happen outside of my control. </li>
            <li>i cant control other's thoughts, actions, or feelings, and to do so is denying another's freedom as well as denying my own. </li>
            <li>I think my brain's really good at looking out for me. It tries to keep me as safe as possible, and quite frankly its impressive. It's equally scary how capable it can be, but at the end of the day, its trying to help me out</li>
            <li>so that means its my job to differentiate whether or not thats what's needed</li>
          </ul>
